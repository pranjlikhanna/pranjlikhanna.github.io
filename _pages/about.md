I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Science, specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My academic journey has been a relentless pursuit of knowledge, where I've honed my programming expertise and deepened my understanding of statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. I thrive on the challenge of designing, training, and optimizing machine learning models across a variety of datasets.

Beyond the screen, you might find me tackling marathons, lost in a captivating book, or experimenting with new culinary creations. I approach each day as a new opportunity to learn, innovate, and create a meaningful impact through technology.

With my degree now in hand, I’m eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge AI solutions, exploring backend systems, or leveraging data science to make informed decisions, I’m ready to dive in and contribute. Let’s connect, collaborate, and explore the possibilities together.
