My academic journey is soon to culminate with a Bachelor's of Science in Cognitive Science, with a specialization in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My journey has been a quest for knowledge, where I've mastered programming languages and delved deep into the world of statistics and data analysis. The magic happens when I design and fine-tune machine learning models on diverse datasets.

Beyond the screen, you'll find me either conquering marathons, immersed in captivating books, or experimenting with culinary delights. I see each day as an opportunity to learn, create, and make a positive impact on the world through technology.

As I stride towards graduation, my focus is on applying my skills and knowledge to real-world challenges. Whether it's diving into the intricacies of backend development or harnessing the power of AI, I'm ready to embrace the future with open arms. So, let's connect, collaborate, and embark on a journey of exploration and innovation together.
