Hi, I'm Pranjli. I’m a **Data Scientist at Carnegie Learning**, working at the intersection of **data**, **technology**, and **education**. I build predictive models, design & validate assessments, and study how student behaviors relate to learning outcomes.

My work combines methods from **psychometrics**, **data science**, and **machine learning** to make sense of complex student data and create tools that help teachers and learners.  

I’m especially interested in the ways AI can make education more personalized and equitable—whether through affect detection, intelligent assessments, or large-scale analytics pipelines. To me, the most exciting part of data science is not just building models, but uncovering meaningful patterns that can have a real impact on people’s lives.  

Outside of work, I’ve always been curious and multi-passionate. You can usually find me running or doing yoga, experimenting in the kitchen, or curled up with a good book.

Thanks for stopping by—I’d love to connect, collaborate, or just chat:)


<!-- I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Science, specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My academic journey has been a relentless pursuit of knowledge, where I've honed my programming expertise and deepened my understanding of statistics, data analysis, and machine learning. I thrive on the challenge of designing, training, and optimizing machine learning models across a variety of datasets.

Beyond the screen, you might find me tackling marathons, lost in a captivating book, or experimenting with new culinary creations. I approach each day as a new opportunity to learn, innovate, and create a meaningful impact through technology.

With my degree now in hand, I’m eager to apply my skills to real-world challenges. Whether it’s developing cutting-edge AI solutions, exploring backend systems, or leveraging data science to make informed decisions, I’m ready to dive in and contribute. Let’s connect, collaborate, and explore the possibilities together.
