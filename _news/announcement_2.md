Excited to share that I am officially a [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) graduate! I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s of Science in Cognitive Science, specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation, finishing my 4 year degree in just 3 years! I want to congratulate my fellow graduates and Tritons for reaching this milestone. Go Tritons! ðŸ’™ðŸ’›
