## Overview
Developed a short diagnostic assessment constructed from a large pool of Carnegie Learning ReadyCheck items. Using **Item Response Theory (IRT)** and machine learning correlations with external outcomes, the screener was validated to provide reliable, predictive measures of student preparedness.

## Approach
- **Item Selection & Calibration**: Applied IRT models to evaluate item quality and select the best-performing subset.  
- **Predictive Validation**: Correlated screener results with end-of-year assessments to ensure predictive power.  
- **Data Pipeline**: Built robust preprocessing and scoring pipelines for large student datasets.  

## Impact
The screener enables early identification of at-risk learners with fewer questions, reducing testing time while maintaining reliability. This project bridged psychometrics and ML to create an assessment now used in live educational contexts.

**Skills demonstrated**: Item Response Theory, ML validation, assessment design, data pipelines.
