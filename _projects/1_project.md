# Project Description

Developed an advanced machine learning model that harnessed TF-IDF vectorization and K-Means clustering to process and categorize a substantial dataset of over 10,000 IMDB movie reviews. This model markedly improved the precision of sentiment analysis and the relevance of movie recommendations. To optimize the performance and efficiency of the analysis, I implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, preserving over 90% of data variance. This method not only retained the integrity of the dataset but also halved the manual analysis time, ensuring the system delivered rapid, accurate insights. The model was further fine-tuned through rigorous accuracy testing to ensure the highest quality of results.
