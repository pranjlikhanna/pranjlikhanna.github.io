# Project Description

Architected and deployed RESTful APIs using Node.js for a simulated logistics platform, focusing on secure and scalable third-party integrations. These APIs, hosted on AWS, are fortified with best practices like load balancing and auto-scaling to manage fluctuating traffic, backed by thorough unit and end-to-end testing to guarantee their robustness and reliability.
