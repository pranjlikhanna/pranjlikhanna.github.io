## Overview
Developed an NLP-driven system that processes **10,000+ IMDB reviews** to classify sentiment and improve recommendation quality. By combining traditional text processing with clustering, the system produced more personalized movie suggestions.  

## Approach
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into features.  
- **K-Means Clustering** to group reviews by sentiment patterns.  
- **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and faster runtime.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** for accuracy optimization.  

## Results
- Improved **sentiment classification precision** and reduced runtime by 50%.  
- Recommendations better aligned with user preferences.  

**Skills demonstrated**: NLP (TF-IDF), clustering, dimensionality reduction, model tuning.
