## Overview
Developed a scalable **NLP pipeline** capable of analyzing over **500,000 social media posts per hour** in real-time. The system leveraged transformer-based models and distributed computing to detect sentiment with high accuracy.  

## Approach
- **Data Collection**: Twitter/Reddit APIs for live stream data.  
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, stemming.  
- **Modeling**: Fine-tuned **BERT** for sentiment polarity (positive/negative/neutral).  
- **Scalability**: Implemented distributed processing using **Apache Spark**.  
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.  

## Results
- Achieved **85% accuracy** in real-time sentiment classification.  
- Successfully scaled to process **500k+ posts/hour**.  
- Provided actionable insights for brands monitoring public opinion.  

**Skills demonstrated**: transformer-based NLP (BERT), big data processing (Spark), distributed systems, real-time sentiment analysis.
