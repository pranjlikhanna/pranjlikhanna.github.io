## Overview
This project focused on developing a robust natural language processing (NLP) tool designed to process vast amounts of social media data. Capable of analyzing over 500,000 posts per hour, the tool achieved an 85% accuracy rate in detecting and categorizing sentiments. The project showcases my ability to handle big data, apply NLP techniques, and derive valuable insights from large-scale textual data streams.

## Problem Statement
With the proliferation of social media, the ability to quickly and accurately gauge public sentiment is crucial for brands, businesses, and organizations. Traditional sentiment analysis models often struggle to handle the scale and real-time nature of these platforms. This project aimed to address these challenges by building a high-performance, scalable sentiment analysis tool capable of processing vast amounts of social media data while maintaining high accuracy.

## Approach & Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Leveraged public APIs from popular social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) to collect real-time textual data for sentiment analysis. The dataset consisted of millions of posts, making it ideal for large-scale text processing and sentiment categorization.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Utilized standard NLP preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming, to clean and prepare the text data.
3. **Sentiment Detection**: Employed advanced sentiment analysis models, such as **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to detect the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) of each post.
4. **Scalability and Performance Optimization**: Implemented parallel processing techniques to ensure that the model could handle upwards of 500,000 posts per hour. Utilized **Apache Spark** for distributed processing to efficiently manage the large-scale data pipeline.
5. **Model Tuning and Evaluation**: Achieved an 85% accuracy rate in sentiment detection after fine-tuning the model with a comprehensive labeled dataset. Evaluated performance using standard metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to ensure robustness and minimize bias.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Machine Learning & NLP Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, NLTK, Scikit-learn
- **Sentiment Analysis Model**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Big Data Framework**: Apache Spark for distributed data processing
- **Data Collection**: Social media APIs (Twitter, Reddit)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## Results & Impact
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieved an 85% accuracy rate in sentiment detection, significantly improving the ability to categorize public opinion across social media platforms.
- **Scalable Processing**: The tool efficiently processed more than 500,000 posts per hour, demonstrating its capability to handle the scale of real-time social media data.
- **Insightful Analytics**: The system provided valuable insights into sentiment trends, offering real-time feedback to brands, businesses, and social media analysts, helping them make data-driven decisions.

## Key Takeaways
This project exemplifies my ability to work with big data and apply advanced NLP techniques to real-world problems. By engineering a scalable, high-performance sentiment analysis tool, I demonstrated expertise in both machine learning model development and data engineering. This solution offers practical applications for industries looking to monitor public sentiment and react to trends in real time.
