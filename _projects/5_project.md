# Project Description

Developed a machine learning model in Python and R to meticulously analyze breast tumor characteristics, like lump thickness and mitosis, accurately predicting malignancy with high precision. This involved rigorous data cleaning and exploratory analysis, with subsequent model refinement via hyperparameter tuning. For practical application, I deployed the model into production using frameworks like Flask, Django, or FastAPI, facilitating its efficient use in real-world medical diagnostics.
