## Overview
Built a predictive model to classify **benign vs. malignant tumors** using breast cancer diagnostic datasets. The project combined careful data preprocessing with supervised ML algorithms to support medical decision-making.  

## Approach
- **Data Cleaning & EDA**: Explored tumor features (clump thickness, mitosis, etc.).  
- **Feature Scaling & Selection** to improve model generalization.  
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and SVMs.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** for optimization.  
- **Deployment**: Prototyped API deployment using Flask/FastAPI for practical use cases.  

## Results
- Achieved high precision and recall across multiple ML models.  
- Produced a deployable prototype for clinical decision support.  

**Skills demonstrated**: classification modeling, healthcare data analysis, deployment prototyping, precision/recall optimization.
