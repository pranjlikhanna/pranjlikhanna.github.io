## Overview
This project focused on predicting home sale prices using a large real-estate dataset inspired by Zillow. By combining **exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and regression models**, I built a predictive pipeline that significantly improved on baseline estimates.  

## Approach
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** to identify key housing features influencing price.  
- **Feature Engineering** to capture location, square footage, and derived metrics.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** for robust non-linear modeling.  
- **Preprocessing Pipelines** automated with Pandas & Scikit-learn.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** for model accuracy.  

## Results
- Reduced margin of error compared to baseline pricing models.  
- Automated preprocessing pipeline improved reproducibility and training efficiency.  

**Skills demonstrated**: regression modeling, feature engineering, pipeline automation, hyperparameter tuning.
