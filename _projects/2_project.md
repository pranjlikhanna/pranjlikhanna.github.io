# Project Description

Leveraging Zillow's extensive dataset, I crafted a predictive model for future home sale prices through in-depth exploratory data analysis and innovative feature engineering. Employing a Random Forest Regressor, the model achieved a notable reduction in margin of error over baseline models, enhancing the precision of home value estimates. I streamlined data handling by automating pre-processing pipelines using Pandas and Scikit-Learn, which not only facilitated efficient data manipulation but also optimized model training and evaluation. The model's predictive accuracy was further refined through meticulous hyperparameter tuning and the application of advanced regression techniques, ensuring robustness and reliability in its predictive capabilities.
