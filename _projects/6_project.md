## Overview
This project investigated whether the **tone of job postings** (neutral vs. subjective) influences company ratings on Glassdoor. We combined **sentiment analysis** with statistical modeling to uncover factors affecting employer reputation.  

## Approach
- **Data Collection** from Kaggle (Data Scientist/Analyst postings + company ratings).  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Vader for neutrality, TextBlob for subjectivity.  
- **Statistical Testing**: Pearson correlation, ANOVA, and linear regression.  
- **Comparisons** with other factors like **salary estimates**.  

## Findings
- Weak correlation between job posting tone and company ratings.  
- **Salary estimates** showed stronger correlation with ratings than posting tone.  
- Highlighted the importance of considering multiple variables in employer branding analysis.  

**Skills demonstrated**: sentiment analysis (Vader, TextBlob), statistical modeling, regression analysis, data storytelling.
