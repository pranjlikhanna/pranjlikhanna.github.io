## Overview
This project is based on my **first-author paper** at the [International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) 2025](https://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2025/proceedings/2025.EDM.short-papers.174/index.html), which was **nominated for Best Paper**.  
Our research examined how **math content readability** and **student reading ability** interact to influence **gaming the system** behaviors in **Carnegie Learningâ€™s MATHia adaptive software**.

## Research Questions
- Are students with lower predicted reading ability more likely to game the system?  
- Do readability characteristics of math problems predict gaming behavior?  
- Can improved readability interventions reduce gaming the system?  

## Methods
- **Readability Metrics**: 32+ features including word count, sentence length, Shannon entropy, and Flesch Reading Ease.  
- **Analysis**: Combined observational + experimental data; statistical modeling and correlation analyses.  

## Key Findings
- Students with lower predicted reading ability are significantly more likely to engage in gaming behaviors.  
- Lessons with **higher readability challenges** saw more gaming the system across both reader groups.  
- Experimental results showed that readability-enhanced lessons **reduced gaming** for stronger readers (non-ER), but not for students with reading difficulties.  
- Readability factors like **word count, entropy, and Flesch Reading Ease** emerged as key predictors of gaming.  

## Impact
This research bridges **psychometrics, NLP, and learning analytics**, showing how **non-math factors** like readability interact with engagement in adaptive math learning.
